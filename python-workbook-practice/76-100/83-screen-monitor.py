#Question: Write a script that detects and prints out your monitor resolution.

#Expected output: 
#Width: 1920,  Height: 1080
# Use the screeninfo  Python third party library

import screeninfo
from screeninfo import get_monitors
 
width=get_monitors()[0].width
height=get_monitors()[0].height
 
print("Width: %s,  Height: %s" % (width, height))


#Explanation:
# We're using the get_monitors  method of the screeninfo  library which can be installed with pip install screeninfo. 
# The get_monitors  method produces a list like [monitor(1920x1080+0+0), monitor(1280x1024+-1280+-31)]  listing all the monitors connected 
# to the computer. Applying [0]  to that list gives the first monitor object out of the list. Applying width  to that monitor object gives 
# the width of the monitor and the same goes for the height  property.
