import pandas
 
data = pandas.read_csv("http://www.pythonhow.com/data/sampledata.txt")
data_2 = data * 2
data_2.to_csv("sampledata_x_2.txt", index=None)


# Explanation:
# As you can see this can be done with pandas  in four lines of code. We use read_csv  to create a pandas dataframe object which is like a 
# table with data. Then we multiply this table by two and then export the calculated data to a text file in our local directory
